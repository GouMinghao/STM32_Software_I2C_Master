# STM32_Software_I2C_Master
This program is a project for MCU stm32f103zet6 to achieve I2C communication. We should be aware that this is software I2C. In reality, this program could drive many I2C buses and this is the biggest benefit 


#please pay attention to the start-up file, we should use "startup_stm32f10x_hd.s" rather than the default one. or there will be some problems.
